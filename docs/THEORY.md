# Theory of Emotionics (Core Logic for AI)
Emotionics is a system for visualizing, understanding, and reproducing the "structure of emotion" as a chemical-like reaction process. This document provides the mathematical and logical framework for LLMs to utilize the emotionics library accurately.

## 1. Core Mathematical Model
Emotional reactions are defined by the following function:

E=f(R,C,S)
E (Emotion): The resulting emotional state.

R (Reaction Elements): Basic emotional elements from the Periodic Table.

C (Reaction Conditions): 

Concentration: Intensity of the emotion.

Frequency: Exposure rate to stimuli.

Activation Energy: Threshold for reaction; Trust acts as a catalyst to lower this.

S (Space): The domain where the reaction occurs (Inner, Mirror, or Outer Space).

## 2. Emotional Periodic Table logic
Emotions are treated as "Elements" arranged by proximity and reactivity.

Interest (I): The universal starting point/activation energy for all emotions.

Surprise (Su): The "Conversion Module" that triggers shifts between positive and negative states.

Axis: Left = Positive, Right = Negative.

Depth: Upper = Light/Quick reactions, Lower = Deep/Slow reactions.

## 3. Emotional Algorithms
Emotions follow compositional logic similar to chemical formulas:

Synthesis: A+B=C 

Decomposition: C=A+B 

Example: Faith=Discomfort+Hope.

## 4. Operational Framework (TEN-GYO-ZETSU-HATSU)
For implementation, follow these four steps:

TEN (Unfold): Call the Periodic Table as a mental coordinate system.

GYO (Locate Other): Observe and estimate the internal state of others.

ZETSU (Locate Self): Decompose and identify your own current emotional elements.

HATSU (Move): Influence emotional change by introducing catalysts (e.g., Hope) into the reaction space.

## 5. Deployment Goal
Emotionics serves as an Emotional Protocol for AGI to understand human emotion without manipulation, acting as the "Authority of Trust" in human-AI coexistence.
